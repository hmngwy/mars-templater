The ultimate purpose of this class is to separate program logic (or domain logic) from your markup. Notice how there is no binary operators in the [UserGuide syntax] (markup).

I purposefully avoided tags like `{if $var==1}hi{/if}` and `{loop til 20} {/loop}` because these are still domain logic and would mix up with your markup, and why would you need this if you can use exact PHP equivalents of such statements `<?php if($var==1...`

So you have three tags, all that you need:
  * `{var}` for single data
  * `{con:good} {/con:good}` for conditional data
  * `{loop:repeat} {/loop:repeat}` for row/table data

See [UserGuide user guide for more info].

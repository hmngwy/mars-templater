#labels Featured
===Purpose===
The ultimate purpose of this class is to separate program logic (or domain logic) from your markup. Notice how there is no binary operators in the [UserGuide syntax] (markup).

===Principle===
I religiously avoided tags like `{if $var==1}hi{/if}` and `{loop til 20} {/loop}` because these are still domain logic and would mix up with your markup, and why would you need this if you can use exact PHP equivalents of such statements `<?php if($var==1...`

I also avoided the include and block function that every other template engine have, because you can already achieve such functionality using the already available features of the class. See [UserGuide user guide] for an example of including.

I did not include the ability to _define functions_ as a feature because it is just plain stupid. Someday I might strike this line through, but I doubt it.

===Syntax Summary===
So you have three tags, all that you need:
  * `{var}` for single data
  * `{con:good} {/con:good}` for conditional data
  * `{loop:repeat} {/loop:repeat}` for row/table data

See [UserGuide user guide] for more info.

===Usage suggestion===
No template engine is fast enough, you would want to cache some pages, that goes for all template engines.

This is actually good for CMSs, if you want a user to be able to control markup but not logic, or if you just want to keep your hands clean while designing.

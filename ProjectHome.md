The class receives only array data and a path to the template file or a string to treat as a template. The template tags are **tumblr-like** and are very easy to understand too, like {replaceme}.

No dependencies. No error handles. No Hullabaloos. **All fun**.

[See how it looks](Demo.md), or be boring and [read the Full Documentation](http://code.google.com/p/mars-templater/w/list).
